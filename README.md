# short_video_platform_scraper
This is a project to scrap data from tiktok, especially in the music information page. This project uses opencv utilities to solve captcha.
Please note that this is tested locally. I tried using it in AWS instance, it didn't work. I provide the example of the result in the csv file. If you only need the part where it solves captcha, just use solve_captcha fucntion.
